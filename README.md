Placeholder replacement for the readme. I will update this as I reach further with this project/website/portfolio.

Need to decide how basic this readme should be, it's not likely to be seen as the actual website will be what's viewed instead of the project files.
If anything at all I could talk about the basic ssetup for each component and/or packages installed.

Some notes for color scheme:
Thinking about using Gold in some form, I need to grab my favorite gold hex from discord. Probably black or a very dark grey as well. I want a dark theme by default or to mabe have a theme choice that's togglable. No bright white! Easy on the eyes but nothing too crazy to keep up the "professionalism."

I've got some design sketches made and I've had my friend help me look over them. I have a solid design for the Projects page and the Home page but I need to think up some ideasfor the Experience and Resume pages.
