Placeholder replacement for the readme. I will update this as I reach further with this project/website/portfolio.

Need to decide how basic this readme should be, it's not likely to be seen as the actual website will be what's viewed instead of the project files.
If anything at all I could talk about the basic ssetup for each component and/or packages installed.
